# Docker Registry Sweeper

A CLI which helps you remove a reference between obsolete Docker images and their blobs for later removing by Docker built-in garbage collection

## How to use this CLI
### Run from Docker Image
```bash
docker run pirsquareff/dksweeper <options>
```

### Options
| Option | Env | Required | Description |
|--------|-----|----------|-------------|
| ``-u, --username <string s>`` | ``DOCKER_USERNAME`` | ``false`` | Username to access Docker Registry |
| ``-p, --password <string s>``	| ``DOCKER_PASSWORD`` | ``false`` | Password to access Docker Registry |
| ``--host <string s>`` | ``REGISTRY_HOST`` | ``true`` | Docker Registry host with a protocol (http, https) |
| ``-r, --repo <string s>`` | ``REPOSITORY`` | ``true`` | Repository for cleanup |
| ``--older-than <integer n>`` | ``OLDER_THAN`` | ``true`` | Delete images older than this value (in days) |
| ``--keep-tag <integer n>`` | ``KEEP_TAG`` | ``true`` | Number of tags to be preserved. It's to prevent deleting entire images in a repo. For example, if all the tags are obsolete (by --older-than), this parameter is to make sure that ``n`` latest tags will not be unlinked. |
| ``--verbose`` | ``VERBOSE`` | ``false`` | Print info during processing |


## How to run garbage collection in Docker Registry
```bash
bin/registry garbage-collect /etc/docker/registry/config.yml
```

Change a path to a config.yml file to match with your configuration. For further information, please consult an official documentation [here](https://docs.docker.com/registry/garbage-collection/).

> Note: You should ensure that the registry is in read-only mode or not running at all. If you were to upload an image while garbage collection is running, there is the risk that the imageâ€™s layers are mistakenly deleted leading to a corrupted image.
